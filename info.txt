fslstats 
Usage: fslstats [preoptions] <input> [options]

preoption -t will give a separate output line for each 3D volume of a 4D timeseries
preoption -K < indexMask > will generate seperate n submasks from indexMask, for indexvalues 1..n where n is the maximum index value in indexMask, and generate statistics for each submask
Note - options are applied in order, e.g. -M -l 10 -M will report the non-zero mean, apply a threshold and then report the new nonzero mean

-l <lthresh> : set lower threshold
-u <uthresh> : set upper threshold
-r           : output <robust min intensity> <robust max intensity>
-R           : output <min intensity> <max intensity>
-e           : output mean entropy ; mean(-i*ln(i))
-E           : output mean entropy (of nonzero voxels)
-v           : output <voxels> <volume>
-V           : output <voxels> <volume> (for nonzero voxels)
-m           : output mean
-M           : output mean (for nonzero voxels)
-s           : output standard deviation
-S           : output standard deviation (for nonzero voxels)
-w           : output smallest ROI <xmin> <xsize> <ymin> <ysize> <zmin> <zsize> <tmin> <tsize> containing nonzero voxels
-x           : output co-ordinates of maximum voxel
-X           : output co-ordinates of minimum voxel
-c           : output centre-of-gravity (cog) in mm coordinates
-C           : output centre-of-gravity (cog) in voxel coordinates
-p <n>       : output nth percentile (n between 0 and 100)
-P <n>       : output nth percentile (for nonzero voxels)
-a           : use absolute values of all image intensities
-n           : treat NaN or Inf as zero for subsequent stats
-k <mask>    : use the specified image (filename) for masking - overrides lower and upper thresholds
-d <image>   : take the difference between the base image and the image specified here
-h <nbins>   : output a histogram (for the thresholded/masked voxels only) with nbins
-H <nbins> <min> <max>   : output a histogram (for the thresholded/masked voxels only) with nbins and histogram limits of min and max

Note - thresholds are not inclusive ie lthresh<allowed<uthresh

FA is a summary measure of microstructural integrity. While FA is highly sensitive to microstructural changes, it is less specific to the type of change.

MD = (λ1+λ2+λ3)/3 

MD is an inverse measure of the membrane density, is very similar for both GM and WM and higher for CSF. MD is sensitive to cellularity, edema, and necrosis.
AD =  λ1 

AD tends to be variable in WM changes and pathology. In axonal injury AD decreases. The ADs of WM tracts have been reported to increase with brain maturation.

RD= (λ2+λ3)/2 

RD increases in WM with de- or dys-myelination. Changes in the axonal diameters or density may also influence R
